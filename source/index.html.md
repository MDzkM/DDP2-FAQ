# Introduction

Welcome to the DDP 2 FAQ website! Here you can find information about how tos and common pitfalls that you might encounter down the line. The only language provided as an example here is Java which corresponds to the primary language used in the course.

# Sample Program

Now we are going to create the obligatory `Hello World` code like we do everytime we learn a new language.

> Create this sample program in a file named HelloWorld.java

```java
class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }
}
```

# Compiling and Running Program

Now that you've created the template, you can see what output it produces.

> You can run it by compiling it first

```shell
javac HelloWorld.java && java HelloWorld
```
